# adbDeviceTracker
Tracks connected adb devices using a websocket connection

# Usage

Add this repository to your project using your prefered package manager:
```
npm i CodePellet/adbDeviceTracker
```
Import `ADBDeviceTracker` as package in your Javascrip or Typescript file:
```ts
import { AdbDeviceTracker } from 'adbDeviceTracker';
```
Create a new instance of AdbDeviceTracker:
```ts
const tracker = new AdbDeviceTracker();
```

# Configuration
The tracker can be instantiated with a few options to make it more versatile. The following options are available:
- `host`: The host address to connect to
- `port`: The host port of the socket
- `autoReconnect`:
    - `enabled`: Boolean value wether the connection to the socket should be automatically reconnected
    - `intervall`: The intervall in `ms` for the reconnect attempts

These options can be passed as an object with the following structure:

> The following values represent the default values if non are provided!

```ts
const tracker = new AdbDeviceTracker({
    host: "127.0.0.1",
    port: 5037,
    autoReconnect:{
        enabled: true,
        intervall: 1000
    }
});
```

# Handling Events
Since this module extends the `EventEmitter` class, the `AdbDeviceTracker` will emit the following custom events:
- info: Info event to provide non critical infos
- data: A collection of all currently connected adb devices on the connected socket
- error: Error events e.g. tracking could not be started or the socket was closed

Furthermore the `start` method of the `AdbDeviceTracker` returns the raw socket created when the `AdbDeviceTracker` was instantiated. This way you are welcome
to handle the socket events yourself if you want to track more than what this module provides.

# Examples

## Track Events emitted from the `AdbDeviceTracker`

```ts
import { AdbDeviceTracker } from "adbdevicetracker";

const tracker = new AdbDeviceTracker();

tracker
    .on("info", (message): void => {
        console.info(message);
    })

    .on("data", (adbDevices): void => {
        console.info(adbDevices);
    })

    .on("error", (error): void => {
        console.log("######", error);
    })
```

## Track Events emitted from the return socket connection of the `start` method

```ts
import { AdbDeviceTracker } from "adbdevicetracker";

const tracker = new AdbDeviceTracker();

/**
 * Track events emitted by the returned socket of the start() method
 */
const socket = tracker.start();
socket
    .on("connect", (): void => {
        console.info("Socket connected successful");
    }).on("data", (data: Buffer): void => {
        console.debug("Data from Socket", data.toString());
    })
```
